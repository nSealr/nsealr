# nSealr restart and execution

This is the engineering direction adopted for the restart. It does not mark future implementation or hardware tasks complete. Product software is pre-production.

The October 18 execution adds independently reviewed product requirements, source disposition, secret ownership, reproducible software tooling and bounded KiCad qualification. Read [the current task graph](../../plan/work-items.json) for accepted candidates, integration records and open work. Earlier readiness views are dated snapshots, not current status.

The objective is a useful Nostr signer ecosystem with accessible connected hardware, two independent offline implementations and a general-purpose programmable security board. Success means real client interoperability, understandable approval, reliable recovery and reproducible third-party development.

2. [Repository and naming decisions](repositories.md)
3. [Execution and acceptance](execution.md)
4. [Measured source baseline](baseline.md)
5. [Machine-readable implementation graph](../../plan/work-items.json)
6. [Decision validation and feasibility limits](validation.md)
7. [Client and optical qualification](../product/client-qualification.md)
8. [Specification-first development and initial work packages](development.md)
9. [Product contract, feature matrix and user journeys](../product/contract.md)
10. [PCB pipeline, tool capabilities and reference designs](pcb-development.md)

The graph records **47 implementation tasks**, their dependencies, scope, acceptance and required resources. A research result or administrative rename does not close an implementation gate. Ready tasks still require source reconciliation and an accepted brief before implementation. No device release is qualified.

## Start here on the next session

Verify the actual checkout and run `python3 scripts/validate_restart_plan.py`. Follow [the execution handoff](implementation/handoff.md), reconcile actual branches/PRs with the graph, and select eligible work without duplicating an active author. Preserve the existing reviewed evidence; do not rerun completed tasks merely because a new session starts. Source changes, failures or unresolved concerns determine which checks must run again.

The local A02 rehearsal has passed distinct source review for product `daf8ba03` and author `bb03361`. This adoption branch appends its exact public evidence/tooling and reconciles seven assigned incomplete checkpoints; read the [current adoption handoff](implementation/A02/coordinator-adoption/handoff.md) and its copy inventories. Exact final adoption-diff review, actual protected PR CI, normal integration and actual main CI remain separate gates. A02 stays open in the initial PR; the frozen source main is `f2ef70f`. The sole moved graph is `plan/work-items.json`; the historical pause proposal is not another adopted tracker. Source notices/archival and registry publication are excluded from this scope. Physical resources can block one profile without blocking the others.

## Delivery order

The first software milestone is a real request → device review → one-use authorization → valid response on an accessible board, with the expected key identity verified end to end. Offline Pi/P4 feasibility and board electronics research run alongside it. No date is promised before measured throughput and physical lead times exist.

The first public release is whichever retained profile satisfies its own safety and usability gates. General Board/SDK delivery has its own non-Nostr acceptance and does not wait for a complete wallet, SSH or FIDO application.

Old documentation, firmware profiles and fixtures remain source material during migration. Names and behavior inherited from them are not a compatibility commitment. Remove replaced active code when the replacement is verified; history remains in Git.

The diagram is the target architecture. It does not claim the depicted applications or PCB are already implemented. The SDK supports one trusted firmware image initially; future SSH/FIDO/wallet firmware needs separate application qualification.
